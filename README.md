# RSA
RSA algorithm implemented in c++

# Dependencies
- C++ compiler such as g++ or clang
- Boost c++ library in order to use big numbers

# How to use
In "src" folder, there is a make file which has two commands
- make (compiles the entire project)
- clean (cleans up the project)

# Limitations
Right now only numbers can be used as messages and not too big numbers can be used and the numbers have to be relatively small. This is being worked on and hopefylly an updated version can be released shortly.
