# RSA
RSA algorithm implemented in c++

# Dependencies
- C++ compiler such as g++ or clang
- Boost c++ library in order to use big numbers

# Setup
Compile the project using:

```sudo make```

you can then decompile using:

```sudo make clean```

# Limitations
Right now only numbers can be used as messages and not too big numbers can be used and the numbers have to be relatively small. This is being worked on and hopefylly an updated version can be released shortly.
